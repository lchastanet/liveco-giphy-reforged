# Livecoding fetch Giphy API and demo of tailwind

Clone this repository and :

```shell
$ npm i
```

You'll need an [Giphy API key](https://developers.giphy.com/) to make it work properly.

When you have it, create a `.env` file in the directory, then declare a `VITE_GIPHY_API` variable and put your API key as value.

```shell
$ npm run dev
```
